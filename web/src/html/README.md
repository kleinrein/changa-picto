# HTML Assets
If you are using gulp-starter with another platform that handles markup, delete this folder and the `tasks.html` config in `gulpfile.js/config.json`, and don't forget to [configure BrowserSync to watch your platform's template files](https://browsersync.io/docs/options/#option-files) for changes!

If you are using gulp-starter as a standalone static site builder, this is where your markup goes. I've provided a few [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) folders and files to get you started:

- **data:** contains a `global.json` file where you can put data that will be made accessible to your templates
- **layouts:** A basic Nunjucks layout file
- **macros:** Contains a helpers file with a `sprite` macro for use with the SVG Sprite task.
- **shared:** A folder to put shared partials, with an empty `app-icons.html` file to remind you to generate your favicons and app icons!
- **index.html:** Hello world! Uses `layouts/application.html`.

### Tasks and Files
```
gulpfile.js/tasks/html
```
Robust templating with [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/). Nunjucks is nearly identical in syntax to Twig (PHP), and replaces Swig (and Twig-like js templating language), which is no longer maintained.
Blendid supports adding custom Nunjucks filters via `task-config.js` by passing `html.manageEnv`. For example:
```js
html: {
  manageEnv: function(env) {
    env.addFilter('excited', function(input) {
      return (input + '!')
    })
  }
}
```

A global data file is set up at [src/html/data/global.json](src/html/data/global.json), is read in by the `html` task, and exposes the properties to your html templates. See [social-icons-font.html](src/html/shared/social-icons-font.html) for example usage.
